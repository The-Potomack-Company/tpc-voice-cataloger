# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-06)

**Core value:** Auctioneers can dictate catalog entries by voice and get structured, accurate auction catalog data faster than typing — with entries flowing directly into RFC Invaluable.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 complete — ready for Phase 2

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 8 (Foundation) - COMPLETE
Plan: 2 of 2 in current phase (all complete)
Status: Phase complete
Last activity: 2026-03-06 — Plan 01-02 complete (app shell + PWA verification)

Progress: [██████████] 100% of Phase 1

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: 5min
- Total execution time: 0.17 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Foundation | 2/2 | 10min | 5min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (6min), 01-02 (4min)
- Trend: improving

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Stack: React 19 + Vite 7 + TypeScript 5 + Tailwind CSS 4 + Zustand 5 + Dexie 4 + `@google/genai` 1.x (confirmed by research)
- Routing: Pathname-based (React Router v7) — required to prevent iOS microphone re-prompts on navigation
- Storage: Dexie/IndexedDB as sole source of truth — audio blobs written immediately on recording stop, never held in React state
- AI approach: Single Gemini call for transcription + field extraction (no separate Whisper step)
- Export: Versioned JSON schema (`"version": 1`) shared as TypeScript interface between PWA and extension
- [01-01] Dexie PKs: ++id auto-increment integers (not UUID) — no cloud sync planned
- [01-01] Tailwind CSS 4: all customization in @theme CSS blocks, no tailwind.config.js
- [01-01] Test files excluded from tsconfig.app.json to prevent Node.js type conflicts
- [Phase 01-foundation]: PWA shell verified on device - bottom tabs, walkthrough, install banner, dark mode all confirmed working

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Pre-Phase 4] API key security for Gemini — must decide: backend proxy vs. shared secret header for 2-5 person internal tool before Phase 5 begins
- [Pre-Phase 5] Confirm Gemini accepts both `audio/mp4` (iOS) and `audio/webm;codecs=opus` (Android) inline base64 at Phase 5 start
- [Pre-Phase 7] RFC Invaluable DOM selectors (`#fld1`, `#fld2`) must be verified against live site before Phase 7 — may have changed since extension was written
- [Pre-Phase 7] Confirm whether `reports.r3?mm=data` import endpoint accepts programmatic requests (check via DevTools Network at Phase 7 start)
